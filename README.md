# Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create an application to recommend Spotify songs to users based on their songs preferences. Songs found within the Spotify database have a number of characteristics that we will be analyzing using Machine Learning. 

id (Id of track generated by Spotify)
Numerical:
acousticness (Ranges from 0 to 1)
danceability (Ranges from 0 to 1)
energy (Ranges from 0 to 1)
duration_ms (Integer typically ranging from 200k to 300k)
instrumentalness (Ranges from 0 to 1)
valence (Ranges from 0 to 1)
popularity (Ranges from 0 to 100)
tempo (Float typically ranging from 50 to 150)
liveness (Ranges from 0 to 1)
loudness (Float typically ranging from -60 to 0)
speechiness (Ranges from 0 to 1)
year (Ranges from 1921 to 2020)
Dummy:
mode (0 = Minor, 1 = Major)
explicit (0 = No explicit content, 1 = Explicit content)
Categorical:
key (All keys on octave encoded as values ranging from 0 to 11, starting on C as 0, C# as 1 and so onâ€¦)
artists (List of artists mentioned)
release_date (Date of release mostly in yyyy-mm-dd format, however precision of date may vary)
name (Name of the song)

# Research Questions
1. What is the most popular type of music ?
2. Based on user preferences, can we predict other songs that users may enjoy?
