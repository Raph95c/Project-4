# Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create an application to recommend Spotify songs to users based on their songs preferences. Songs found within the Spotify database have a number of characteristics that we will be analyzing using Machine Learning. 


# Research Questions
1. What is the most popular type of music ?
2. Based on user preferences, can we predict other songs that users may enjoy?
