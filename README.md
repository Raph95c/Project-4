# Research Questions
1. Who will be the next Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the 2022-2023 NBA Season? 
2. Which teams have the strongest aggregated statistics? 

# Project 
In this project, a Sports show wants us to predict the next MVP of the season by using the NBA data from 2010 to now. To accomplish this assignment, we will be analyzing player statistics using machine learning, Matplotlib, Tableau and Leaflet.js.
