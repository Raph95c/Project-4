# Background

Song and playlist prediction using machine learning is an emerging field that aims to provide personalized music recommendations to users based on their listening habits and preferences. The idea behind this technology is to analyze large amounts of data on a user's listening history, such as the songs they have played, skipped, or added to their playlists, and use this information to predict the types of songs and playlists that they will enjoy in the future.

The development of this technology is made possible by advances in machine learning and data analysis techniques. The algorithms used to predict song and playlist preferences rely on a variety of factors, including the user's age, gender, location, and musical tastes, as well as data on the popularity and characteristics of different songs and artists.

One of the key challenges in developing accurate song and playlist prediction models is the sheer volume and complexity of the data involved. With millions of songs and countless variations in musical style and genre, it can be difficult to identify patterns and trends that accurately reflect individual user preferences. To overcome this challenge, machine learning algorithms are trained on large datasets that contain vast amounts of information on user listening habits, as well as on the characteristics of different songs and artists.

Once a machine learning model has been trained, it can be used to predict the types of songs and playlists that a user is most likely to enjoy. This information can then be used to generate personalized recommendations, which can be delivered to the user through a variety of channels, such as music streaming services, mobile apps, or social media platforms.

Overall, the development of song and playlist prediction using machine learning has the potential to revolutionize the way that people discover and enjoy new music. By providing personalized recommendations based on individual listening habits and preferences, this technology can help users to discover new artists and genres, and to create playlists that reflect their unique musical tastes and moods.

# Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create an application to recommend Spotify songs to users based on their songs preferences. Songs found within the Spotify database have a number of characteristics that we will be analyzing using Machine Learning. 


# Research Questions
1. What is the most popular type of music ?
2. Based on user preferences, can we predict other songs that users may enjoy?
